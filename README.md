# Projectile Motion Calculator

This is a web-based application built using Flask that calculates and visualizes the trajectory of a projectile given its initial velocity and launch angle. The application provides detailed results including the time of flight, horizontal range, and maximum height, along with an interactive graph that shows the trajectory and velocity vectors.

## Features

- Input initial velocity and launch angle to calculate projectile motion.
- Display detailed results including time of flight, horizontal range, and maximum height.
- Interactive graph displaying the projectile's trajectory.
- Visualization of velocity vectors along the trajectory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Plotly

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/projectile-motion-calculator.git
   cd projectile-motion-calculator
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Enter the initial velocity and launch angle, then click "Calculate" to see the results and the interactive graph.

## Example

1. Enter the initial velocity (e.g., 20 m/s) and launch angle (e.g., 45 degrees).
2. Click "Calculate".
3. The application will display:
   - Time of flight: 2.04 seconds
   - Horizontal range: 40.82 meters
   - Maximum height: 10.20 meters
4. The graph will show the trajectory of the projectile along with the velocity vectors.
